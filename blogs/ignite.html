        <p>
            Ignite is a basic Entity Component System if we can call it as such. At it's core, it uses
            Nodes which are entities, Components and Systems.

            <a id="nodes" class="chapter-title" href="ignite.html#nodes"><strong>Nodes</strong></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            A node is an object represented by it's id. In Ignite, nodes also act as components containers, each node
            containing it's components.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a id="components" class="chapter-title" href="ignite.html#components"><strong>Components</strong></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            A component is a datatype that can be added to or removed from nodes.
            Components in ECS are generally plain data types and not encapsulated and Ignite is no exception.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a id="systems" class="chapter-title" href="ignite.html#systems"><strong>Systems</strong></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            A system is an executable object that is matched with all nodes that have a certain set of components.
            Nodes are registered in a system with a filter set to the system.
            Then at runtime, every nodes with matching components will be registerd in the system.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a id="worlds" class="chapter-title" href="ignite.html#worlds"><strong>Worlds</strong></a>
        </p>
        <p>
            A world is where all ECS data is stored. In Ignite we can have multiple worlds which can communicate with
            each. This allow us to dissociate data and logic through multiple environnements.
