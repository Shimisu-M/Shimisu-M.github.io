            Ignite ECS Framework
        </div>
        <p>
            Ignite is a basic C# Entity Component System (ECS) framework.
        </p>

        <div id="nodes" class="chapter-title">
            <a href="ignite.html#nodes">Nodes</a>
        </div>
        <p>
            A node is an object represented by it's id existing in a world. In Ignite, nodes also act as components
            containers, each node containing it's components. We can also create a hierarchy for nodes to help us
            organize our projects.<br>
            In Ignite, the nodes ids works in a bit of a strange way, they are coded on a 64 bytes unsigned integer
            which is split if 3 segments
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first 32 bytes represent the node id.</li>
            <li>Then the next 16 bytes represent the node generation.</li>
            <li>And the last 16 bytes are used as flags to help us know the state of the node.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This allow us to have 2<sup>48</sup> different ids in addition to let us query for nodes with certain
            flags.<br>

        <div id="components" class="chapter-title">
            <a href="ignite.html#components">Components</a>
        </div>
        <p>
            A component is a datatype that can be added to or removed from nodes.
            Components in ECS are generally plain data types and not encapsulated and Ignite is no exception.
        </p>

        <div id="systems" class="chapter-title">
            <a href="ignite.html#systems">Systems</a>
        </div>
        <p>
            A system is an executable object that is matched with all nodes that have a certain set of components using
            a filter. At runtime, every nodes with matching components will be registerd in the system. The system will
            then execute some code we've made for each nodes registered.
        </p>

        <div id="contexts" class="chapter-title">
            <a href="ignite.html#contexts">Contexts</a>
        </div>
        <p>
            A context is a tracker object that register valid nodes for a system. It allow us to process nodes more
            efficiently when a system execute itself.
        </p>

        <div id="worlds" class="chapter-title">
            <a href="ignite.html#worlds">Worlds</a>
        </div>
        <p>
            A world is where all ECS data is stored. In Ignite we can have multiple worlds which can communicate with
            each. This allow us to dissociate data and logic through multiple environnements.
